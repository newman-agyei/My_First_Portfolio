    <h1>This is the first paragraph</h1>
    <p>
      Separating paragraphs with blank lines is easiest for readers to scan, but
      they can also be separated by indenting their first lines. This is often
      used to take up less space, such as to save paper in print.
    </p>

    <h2>This is the second paragraph</h2>
    <p>
      Writing that is intended to be edited, such as school papers and rough
      drafts, uses both blank lines and indentation for separation. In finished
      works, combining both is considered redundant and amateurish.
